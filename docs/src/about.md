Hanson Robotics has enchanted and captured the imagination of the world with uncannily humanlike robots endowed with remarkable expressiveness, aesthetics, and interactivity. Our robots will soon engage and live with us to teach, serve, entertain, delight, and provide comforting companionship. They will learn from us and we will learn from them. Every human interaction will have an impact on how they develop and who theyâ€™ll eventually become.

In the not-too-distant future, Genius Machines will walk among us. They will be smart, kind, and wise. Together, man and machine will create a better future for the world.
